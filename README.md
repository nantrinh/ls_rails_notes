# Rails Notes

This repo contains my notes for each lesson of the Launch School 5301 Rapid Prototyping with Ruby on Rails course. There are some differences in my implementations vs. those in the course videos, but the main ideas are the same.

The biggest differences are:
- I use Rails 6 and Ruby 2.5.3. The course uses Rails 4 and Ruby 2.
- I do not use Twitter Bootstrap. The course does.

This is how I studied in this course:
1. Walk through the entire lesson with the videos.
2. Compile the assignment requirements, then do it myself without referencing the videos. I consulted the Rails 6 documentation to make sure I was using Rails 6 syntax. I documented the code I wrote for the Rails 6 implementations, and any notable things I learned while doing this step, in the `lesson_x` directories.

## Contents of this repository
- `lesson_x` directories contain relevant material for each lesson.
- `flashcards` contains notes that I intend to format in a quiz-friendly manner.
- `video_notes` contains text files for select videos with timestamped topics, so you can easily navigate to the relevant part of the hour-long lecture videos. The timestamps are in `length_of_video - where_you_are_in_the_video` format, because that is what is displayed in the LS video controller and thus easier for me to jot down as I watch the videos. I may format them more nicely in the future but it is not a high priority.
- `images` contains images I use in the READMEs.
