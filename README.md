# Rails Notes
![](gifs/lesson_4.gif)
This repo contains my notes for each lesson of the Launch School 5301 Rapid Prototyping with Ruby on Rails course. There are some differences in my implementations vs. those in the course videos, but the main ideas are the same.

The biggest differences are:
- I use Rails 6 and Ruby 2.6.5. The course uses Rails 4 and Ruby 2.
- I use Bootstrap 4. The course uses an earlier version of Bootstrap.
- I use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite3.
- I start deploying in lesson 1 instead of in lesson 3.

The finished app is live [here](https://still-crag-40731.herokuapp.com).
