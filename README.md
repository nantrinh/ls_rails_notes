# Rails Notes

This repo contains my notes for each lesson of the Launch School 5301 Rapid Prototyping with Ruby on Rails course. There are some differences in my implementations vs. those in the course videos, but the main ideas are the same.

The biggest differences are:
- I use Rails 6 and Ruby 2.5.3. The course uses Rails 4 and Ruby 2.
- I do not use Twitter Bootstrap. The course does.

## Contents of this repository
- `lesson_x` directories contain relevant material for each lesson.
- `flashcards` contains notes that I intend to format in a quiz-friendly manner.
- `video_notes` contains text files for select videos with timestamped topics, so you can easily navigate to the relevant part of the hour-long lecture videos. The timestamps are in `length_of_video - where_you_are_in_the_video` format, because that is what is displayed in the LS video controller and thus easier for me to jot down as I watch the videos. I may format them more nicely in the future but it is not a high priority.
- `images` contains images I use in the READMEs.
