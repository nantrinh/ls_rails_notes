# Rails Notes

This repo contains my notes for each lesson of the Launch School 5301 Rapid Prototyping with Ruby on Rails course. There are some differences in my implementations vs. those in the course videos, but the main ideas are the same.

The biggest differences are:
- I use Rails 6 and Ruby 2.5.3. The course uses Rails 4 and Ruby 2.
- I do not use Twitter Bootstrap. The course does.

## Contents of this repository
- `lesson_x` directories contain relevant material for each lesson.
- `flashcards` contains notes that I intend to format in a quiz-friendly manner.
- `video_notes` contains timestamped notes for select videos.
- `images` contains images I use in the READMEs.
