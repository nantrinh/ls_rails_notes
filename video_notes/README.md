# Video Notes

This repo contains timestamped notes for select videos. I created these so I could easily navigate to the certain parts of the videos when looking to clarify a certain concept.

The timestamps are in `length_of_video - where_you_are_in_the_video` format, because that is what is displayed in the Launch School video controller and thus easier for me to jot down as I watch the videos.
